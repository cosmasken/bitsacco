# UX Flow Analysis: Share Purchase & Savings Deposit

## Current Flow Issues Identified

### 1. **Confusing Dual Registration System**
- **Issue**: Both `RegisterMemberModal` and `PurchaseSharesModal` exist, but registration is actually done through share purchase
- **Problem**: Users might think they need to register first, then buy shares separately
- **Impact**: Confusion about the onboarding process

### 2. **Inconsistent Share Pricing**
- **Issue**: 
  - `PurchaseSharesModal`: Uses `0.00001 cBTC` per share
  - `useRegisterMember`: Uses `0.001 BTC` per share (100x difference!)
- **Problem**: Price mismatch between UI and backend logic
- **Impact**: Transaction failures and user confusion

### 3. **Poor Visual Hierarchy in Quick Actions**
- **Issue**: All actions appear equally important
- **Problem**: New users don't understand the required sequence (shares → savings → loans)
- **Impact**: Users try to deposit savings before buying shares

### 4. **Inadequate State Management**
- **Issue**: Button states don't clearly communicate prerequisites
- **Problem**: Disabled buttons don't explain why they're disabled
- **Impact**: Users don't understand what they need to do next

### 5. **Missing Onboarding Guidance**
- **Issue**: No clear explanation of the Sacco membership process
- **Problem**: Users don't understand they become members by purchasing shares
- **Impact**: Confusion about how to get started

### 6. **Inconsistent Error Handling**
- **Issue**: Generic error messages that don't help users understand the problem
- **Problem**: "execution reverted" messages are not user-friendly
- **Impact**: Poor user experience when transactions fail

## Recommended UX Improvements

### 1. **Streamline Registration Process**
```typescript
// Remove RegisterMemberModal entirely
// Make PurchaseSharesModal the primary onboarding flow
// Add clear messaging: "Become a member by purchasing shares"
```

### 2. **Fix Price Consistency**
```typescript
// Standardize on one price across all components
const SHARE_PRICE = "0.00001"; // Use this everywhere
const MINIMUM_SHARES = 10; // Adjust minimum accordingly
```

### 3. **Implement Progressive Disclosure**
```typescript
// Show actions in logical order with clear states:
// 1. Purchase Shares (Primary CTA for non-members)
// 2. Deposit Savings (Enabled after membership)
// 3. Request Loan (Enabled after savings)
// 4. Provide Guarantee (Advanced feature)
```

### 4. **Add Contextual Help**
```typescript
// Add tooltips and help text explaining:
// - Why buttons are disabled
// - What each action does
// - Prerequisites for each action
```

### 5. **Improve Visual Design**
```typescript
// Use visual cues to show progression:
// - Step indicators
// - Progress bars
// - Clear success states
```

## Proposed New Flow

### For New Users:
1. **Landing**: Clear explanation of Sacco membership
2. **Connect Wallet**: Prominent wallet connection
3. **Purchase Shares**: Primary CTA with clear pricing

6. **Advanced Features**: Loans and guarantees

### For Existing Members:
